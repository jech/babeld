8 August 2012: babeld-1.3.4

  * Disable atomic route changes on Linux; this used to cause stuck
    unreachable routes on non-multipath kernels.
  * Improve error checking in command-line and configuration parser.

12 July 2012: babeld-1.3.3

  * More fixes to IPv4 support on BSD -- pure meshes are now
    supported.
  * Fixed a very rare bug where an unfeasible route could be
    selected.

30 June 2012: babeld-1.3.2

  * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: removed parasitic mode (-P).
  * Fixes to IPv4 support on BSD.
  * More reduction to the rate of sending requests.  

11 February 2012: babeld-1.3.1

  * Made the resend logic less aggressive.  This should lead to fewer
    request messages upon link failure, at the cost of somewhat worse
    behaviour in the presence of heavy packet loss.
  * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: removed the idle detection functionality (-i).
    This feature was little used and complicated the code somewhat.
  * Various internal tweaks to bring babeld closer to the Quagga version.

8 December 2011: babeld-1.3.0

  * Made the route table into a sorted array, and use binary sort for
    searching for routes.  This makes most route operations O(log n), at
    a slight cost in memory usage.
  * Changed the update sending strategy to use buffers large enough for
    a full update.  This makes the duplicate suppression mechanism
    effective in large networks, at a small cost in memory usage.
  * Rate-limit the reaction to wildcard requests.  This avoids an update
    storm at boot in large networks.
  * Fixed a bug that prevented usage of the "default" keyword in
    configuration files.

16 October 2011: babeld-1.2.1

  * Fixed an incorrect assertion that would cause a crash when -w was
    being used (reported by Thomas McLure).

9 September 2011: babeld 1.2.0

  * Merged the interference-aware branch ("babelz").  Please see the
    "-z" flag in the manual page.
  * Fixed a memory leak when expiring resent messages.
  * Fixed a buffer overflow when parsing MAC addresses (Matthieu Boutier).
  * Implemented MAC address parsing for BSD (Matthieu Boutier).

27 August 2011: babeld 1.1.4

  * Change the default port number to 6696, as allocated by IANA.

3 August 2011: babeld 1.1.3

  * Implemented an option -u to keep unfeasible routes; this is useful
    for giving more data to front-end interfaces.
  * Fixed a number of minor bugs in the front-end interface.
  * Fixed incorrect handling of interfaces with multiple link-local
    addresses (thanks to Matthieu Boutier).

27 July 2011: babeld 1.1.2:

  * Changed the strategy used to tweak an installed route in a way that
    should avoid packet loss (thanks to Dave Taht).
  * Fixed the handling of duplicate interface definitions in the config
    file (thanks to Matthieu Boutier).

16 May 2011: babeld 1.1.1:

  * Fixed two bugs in the message parser that could cause IPv4 updates to
    get lost.
  * Fixed a bug in the monitoring interface that could cause route ids
    to change (thanks to Gabriel Kerneis).
  * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: the default wired hello interval is now 4 seconds.
  * Ported to Bionic libc.

30 January 2011: babeld 1.1.0:

  * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: the UDP port number and multicast group have
    been changed to be the ones allocated by IANA.
  * Initial port to OpenBSD, by Vincent Gross.

1 October 2010: babeld 1.0.2:

  * Worked around a gcc bug that would cause assertion failures on MIPS.

2 May 2010: babeld 1.0.1:

  * Fixed a bug that could cause input filters to be ignored.

22 April 2010: babeld 1.0:

  * Minor portability fixes.

8 February 2010: babeld 0.98:

  * Implement the ability to prefer Babel routes to external routes
    according to the kernel priority (-A).
  * Implement the ability to redistribute "boot" routes when the protocol
    is explicitly specified on the "redistribute" line.
  * Allow trailing whitespace in config file.

5 November 2009: babeld 0.97:

  * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: rename babel.{conf,log} to babeld.*.
  * Use getopt for parsing command-line options.

11 August 2009: babeld 0.96

  * Renamed babel to babeld.
  * Routes are now automatically flushed when an interface goes down or an
    IPv4 address changes, which avoids desynchronisation between Babel and
    the kernel.

21 April 2009: babel 0.95

  * Fixed a bug that broke link-quality estimation, and could cause
    severe instability when we had both good and marginal neighbours.
  * We now send retractions after a redistributed route is retracted.
  * Fixed a bug that could cause reliable messages (retractions and
    router-id switches) to only be sent twice.
  * We no longer obey a silent time at startup, instead sending a bunch of
    retractions.  The silent time is inconvenient, but seldom useful.
  * Updates for routes to self are now sent together with other updates
    (they used to be sent more frequently).
  * Fixes the configuration parser to interpret hello-interval as a number
    of seconds, as specified in the documentation (it used to be interpreted
    as a number of milliseconds).
  * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: the update interval is now a per-interface value,
    may be configured manually in the configuraton file, and defaults to
    4 times the hello interval.  The -u flag is gone.

10 April 2009: babel 0.94

  * Fixed a bug introduced in 0.17 that caused recently retracted routes to
    remain until the routing table entry was flushed.
  * Implemented per-interface configuration of parameters such as link
    cost, hello interval etc.  The command-line flags are now only used to
    set defaults.

15 March 2009: babel 0.93

  * No longer update seqno periodically, rely on explicit seqno requests.

21 January 2009: babel 0.92

  * Fixed a bug that could cause a crash if an interface was repeatedly
    brought down and then back up.
  * Implemented some protection against time stepping when POSIX clocks are
    not available.

10 November 2008: babel 0.91

  * Maintain buffered updates per-interface, which makes multi-interface
    nodes significantly less noisy.
  * Changed the strategy for dealing with unfeasible routes to be slightly
    more generous while still avoiding loops.
  * Fixed a bug that would cause multi-hop requests to be spuriously resent.
  * Made a number of micro-optimisations throughout.

23 October 2008: babel 0.90

  * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: all new Babel version 2 protocol, which is both
    more robust and less chatty than version 1.
  * Tweaked the strategies for sending triggered updates and unfeasible
    requests to be more conservative.
  * Minor optimisations all over the place.
  * Removed the protocol specification -- the version 2 spec is maintained
    separately.

18 October 2008: babel 0.17

  * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: removed support for ``inherit'' in redistribution.
  * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: a pidfile is now created by default.
  * Increased the default seqno interval.
  * Use a fixed kernel priority for routes installed by babel.

29 September 2008: babel 0.16

  * Tweaked cost computation to be slightly slower.
  * Implemented a local interface for GUIs.
  * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: the -X command-line option is no more.

8 July 2008: babel 0.15

  * Fixed a bug that could break link-quality estimation on yo-yo links.
  * Protect against duplicate neighbour ids on the same interface.
  * More tweaks to improve scaling with the number of kernel routes.
  * Tweaked the default update interval.

1 July 2008: babel 0.14

  * Use POSIX clocks if available to protect against clock stepping.
  * Made babel use available internal routes straight away when the
    set of redistributed routes changes.
  * Lifted the arbitrary limit on the number of kernel routes.
  * Changed the routing metric used on wireless links to plain ETX.
  * Bridges are now automatically detected and treated as potential
    wireless interfaces.
  * Reduced the default hello interval.

24 May 2008: babel 0.13

  * Removed all arbitrary limits (interfaces, neighbours, routes,
    xroutes and sources).
  * Fixed a bug that prevented expiration of stale sources.
  * Updated the kernel interface to work with recent Linux kernels.
  * More tweaks to the order in which updates are sent.

7 April 2008: babel 0.12

  * Retractions are now sent multiple times, which should speed up
    convergence in presence of packet loss.
  * Optimised the sending of updates to make them smaller.
  * Don't forward requests multiple times; this should reduce the
    noise due to requests with no increase in convergence time.
  * Fixed a bug that could cause a crash when resending requests.
  * Added some protection against clock stepping.

29 March 2008: babel 0.11

  * Implemented sub-second hello and update intervals.
  * Fixed a bug that could prevent the best route from being selected
    for extended periods of time.
  * Implemented protection against out-of-date requests being sent and
    forwarded when a node loses its sequence number.
  * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: reduced the cost of wired networks down to 96
    from 128.
  * Tweaked the frequency at which a router's seqno increases, to make
    it more likely that a feasible route will be available when needed.
  * Implemented garbage collection of old sources.
  * Implemented coalescing of unicast messages.
  * Fixed a bug that could cause a crash when a link's MTU changes.
  * Fixed a bug that could delay noticing that a network is no longer
    idle when running Babel with the -i flag.
  * Fixed a bug that could cause incorrect metrics to be advertised
    when output filtering was used.
  * Fixed a bug that could cause incorrect link costs to be computed when
    a neighbour reduces its hello interval.
  * Fixed some minor issues with the ordering of outgoing messages.

11 March 2008: babel 0.10

  * Implemented the ability to automatically export local addresses (see
    the ``local'' keyword in redistribute specifications).  This should
    avoid the need to explicitly specify -X on the command line
    (Julien Cristau and Juliusz Chroboczek).
  * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: local routes (local interface addresses) are
    now exported by default.  Specify ``redistribute local deny'' to
    avoid that.
  * Babel will now automatically choose a router id if none is
    specified on the command line.
  * Automatically adapt to interfaces appearing or disappearing at runtime,
    as is usually the case when running over tunnels or VPNs.
  * Changed the link quality computation algorithm to not discard very
    lossy links.
  * Multi-hop requests will now be forwarded to an unfeasible successor
    under some circumstances.
  * Send multi-hop requests more aggressively.
  * Send requests for a new seqno upon receiving an unfeasible update
    if it's better than what we have.
  * No longer consider the age of routes in route selection.
  * Added ability to run as a daemon.

14 February 2008: babel 0.9

  * Implemented a proper configuration language to specify input and
    output filters and redistribution policies.
  * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: the flags -4, -x and -c are no longer supported.

8 February 2008: babel 0.8

  * Babel will now automatically check for interfaces' up/down status,
    IPv4 address, and optionally for carrier sense.
  * Implemented the -w option, which disables all optimisations for
    wired interfaces.
  * Implemented support for non-default routing tables.
  * Fixed a bug that could spuriously remove IPv4 routes (thanks to
    Julien Cristau).

3 January 2008: babel 0.7

  * Implemented support for IPv4.
  * Fixed sending of unicast requests.
  * Don't send poison when receiving a request for an unknown route.
  * Basic filtering infrastructure.
  * Removed support for broadcast IHU.
  * Changed the behaviour of -d.

16 October 2007: babel 0.6

  * Implemented resending of unsatisfied requests, with exponential backoff.
  * Fixed a potential crash in the request handling code.
  * Send IHUs more aggressively.

9 October 2007: babel 0.5

  * Implemented forwarding of requests and replies.
  * Fixed a bug that prevented requests from being parsed correctly.
  * Fixed a bug that prevented IHU intervals from being sent.
  * Respect reboot_time even after an id change.
  * Deal with neighbours rebooting and losing their hello seqno when
    computing link quality.

23 September 2007: babel 0.4

  * Fixed incorrect expiration of old sources.  This could prevent
    convergence in some cases.

16 September 2007: babel 0.3

  * Fixes to Mac OS X support (Grégoire Henry).

29 August 2007: babel 0.2

  * Made jitter computation depend on how urgent a given message is.
    This dramatically improves convergence speed, without increasing
    network load.
  * Fixed a bug that prevented neighbour associations from being
    discarded at shutdown.

22 August 2007: babel 0.1

  * Initial public release.
