26 July 2023: babeld-1.13.1

  * Implemented the per-interface option "probe-mtu", which automatically
    discards links with a mis-configured MTU.  Thanks to Daniel Gröber.
  * Fixed a typo in the handing of the option "v4viav6".

16 July 2023: babeld-1.13

  * Removed diversity support and related configuration file directives.
    This is an incompatible change.
  * Optimised route redistribution.  We now install just the route that the
    kernel sent us rather than doing a full route dump on every change.
  * Added optional delay to daemon shutdown; see the configuration option
    "shutdown-delay-ms".  Thanks to Daniel Gröber.
  * Fixed compilation under BSD.  Thanks to Antonin Décimo.

7 February 2023: babeld-1.12.2

  * Fixed reinstalling a Babel route after a redistributed route is
    retracted.  This avoids waiting for a new update after a non-Babel
    route is removed from the routing table.
  * Fixed parsing of the "allow-duplicates" option.  Thanks to Daniel Gröber.
  * Fixed parsing of multiple sub-TLVs in a single TLV.  Since we currently
    never send multiple sub-TLVs, this was not visible in practice, but
    is a serious bug in the packet parser.  Thanks to zmw12306.

18 May 2022: babeld-1.12.1

  * Implemented separate PC values for unicast and multicast, which avoids
    dropping packets protected by MAC when WiFi powersave is active.
    Thanks to Daniel Gröber.
  * Schedule an interface check just after adding an interface.
    Thanks to Andrew Hoff.

5 May 2022: babeld-1.12

  * Implemented v4-via-v6 routing (RFC 9229), which allows a router with
    IPv4 addresses only to route IPv4.  Thanks to Théophile Bastian.
  * Enableed extended Netlink acks when available.
    Thanks to Toke Høyland-Jørgensen.
  * Fixed restoring of interface configuration to avoid unbounded memory
    consumption.  Thanks to andrew-hoff.
  * Fixed handling of deny filters in the install chain.

30 March 2022: babeld-1.11

  * Implemented MAC authentication (RFC 8967).  Thanks to Clara Dô,
    Weronika Kołodziejak and Antonin Décimo.
  * Changed the interface of the add_filter function in order to simplify
    integration in OpenWrt.  Thanks to Nick Hainke.

25 April 2021: babeld-1.10

  * Removed the disambiguation code: source-specific routing is no longer
    supported for IPv4, and for IPv6 only on Linux 3.11 or later.
  * Fixed an issue handling of retractions with no next hop, which caused
    interoperability problems with BIRD.  Thanks to Fabian Bläse.
  * If skip-kernel-setup is set, we no longer disable the rp_filter, which
    makes babeld work in containers.  Thanks to Martin Weinelt.

21 April 2020: babeld-1.9.2

  * Fixed two issues that could cause IPv4 routes to be represented
    incorrectly, with a range of confusing symptoms.  Thanks to
    Fabian Bläse.
  * Fixed incorrect parsing of TLVs with an unknown Address Encoding.
    Thanks to Théophile Bastian.
  * Fixed access to mis-aligned data structure.  Thanks to Antonin Décimo.

20 August 2019: babeld-1.9.1

  * Fixed a crash that could happen when unicast and RTT estimation are
    both enabled on an interface.  Thanks to Dave Taht.
  * Fixed compilation under BSD.  Thanks to Dave Taht.

4 August 2019: babeld-1.9.0

  * Reworked buffering of unicast packets to use a per-neighbour buffer
    rather than a single buffer per interface.  This makes unicast as
    efficient as multicast, at the cost of slightly higher memory usage.
  * Added option "unicast" that allows sending most TLVs over unicast.
    This is necessary for the DTLS extension.
  * Implemented parsing of unicast Hellos.  This makes it possible to
    interoperate with neighbours that only speak unicast (e.g. over some
    kinds of tunnels that only do unicast).
  * Implemented sending of unscheduled unicast Hellos.  This makes the
    RTT extension work over unicast too.
  * Reworked the xroute data structures to use binary search and
    linear-time comparison.
  * Don't attempt to modify the rp_filter sysctl if it already has the
    desired value; this makes it possible to run babeld in an
    unpriviledged container.  Thanks to Christof Schulze.
  * Reinstated logging of late hellos.  Thanks to Dave Taht.
  * Don't send wildcard requests or Hellos to newish nodes.  This makes
    acquisition of new neighbours slower, but drastically reduces noise at
    startup.  Thanks to Teco Boot.
  * Remove an arbitrary limit on the number of interfaces.  Thanks to
    Christof Schulze.
  * Removed class E from martian filter.  Thanks to Dave Taht.
  * Added the ability to set the preferred source address in install filters.
    Thanks to Killian Lufau.
  * Fixed a number of read-only buffer overflows.  Thanks to Leo Stefanesco.

22 July 2019: babeld-1.8.5

  * Fixed a bug that caused confustion between learned routes and
    imported routes (thanks to Fabian Bläse).
  * Fixed a bug that prevented install filters from being evaluated
    (thanks to Killian Lufau).

9 November 2018: babeld-1.8.4

  * Fixed a bug that discarded pipelined commands received on the local
    configuration interface.
  * Added the per-interface option rfc6126-compatible.

24 September 2018: babeld-1.8.3

  * Fixed a read-only two byte buffer overflow in the packet parser.
    This is a read-only overflow, and hence most probably not exploitable.
  * Fixed an issue with creating unreachable routes on recent kernels
    (4.16 and up).  Thanks to Christof Schulze.
  * Notice interface changes faster by listening to more netlink events.
    Thanks to Christof Schulze.
  * Fixed a local interface issue when an interface has no link-local
    address.  Thanks to Christof Schulze.

12 May 2018: babeld-1.8.2

  * Fixed a bug that prevented redistribution of IPv4 routes.  Thanks to
    Niklas Yann Wettengel.

7 April 2018: babeld-1.8.1

  * Implemented parsing of mandatory sub-TLVs and unicast and unscheduled
    Hellos.  This makes this version comply with RFC 6126bis.  However, we
    don't send any of these yet, so this version remains compatible with
    RFC 6126.
  * Fixed a bug that prevented us from sending requests after we lose
    a route.  This makes convergence much faster in some cases, at the
    cost of slightly increased traffic.
  * Fixed interface addresses on some kinds of point-to-point links.
  * The keep-unfeasible (-u) option has been removed, this is now the
    default behaviour.

6 December 2016: babeld-1.8.0

  * Added the ability to reconfigure babeld dynamically from the
    monitoring interface.  This is an incompatible change.
  * Changed the configuration language to use an enumerated type instead
    of the "wired" boolean.  This is an incompatible change.
  * Setting max-rtt-penalty no longer enables timestamps.  This is an
    incompatible change.
  * Added PF_UNIX support to the local interface.  Thanks to Julien Cristau.
  * Made it possible to have a 0 channel number within the diversity extension,
    which is consistent with draft-chroboczek-babel-diversity-routing-01.
  * Fixed a bug (introduced in 1.7.0) that could cause spurious policy
    rules to be created in the kernel.  Thanks to Matthieu Boutier.

14 February 2016: babeld-1.7.1

  * Fix compilation under musl.  Thanks to Gabriel Kerneis.

3 February 2016: babeld-1.7.0

  * Added the ability to choose the kernel routing table on a per-route
    basis.  Thanks to Matthieu Boutier.
  * Refactored the disambiguation code to live above the kernel interface.
    Thanks to Matthieu Boutier.
  * Reworked the source table to function in log time.
  * Optimised the disambiguation code to avoid scanning all routes in
    non-source-specific networks.  Thanks to Matthieu Boutier.
  * Modified the triggered updates logic to no longer send multihop
    requests.  This makes babeld slightly less noisy, at the cost of
    slightly longer reconvergence after mobility.
  * Increased the token bucket limits, which some large meshes are
    starting to hit.
  * Increased the size of the netlink socket buffer.

1 October 2015: babeld-1.6.3

  * Changed the handling of kernel configuration and added the
    skip-kernel-setup option.  Thanks to Toke Høiland-Jørgensen.
  * Added the option "router-id" and removed the flag "-R".  This is an
    incompatible change.

31 July 2015: babeld-1.6.2

  * Added the ability to specify a router-id explicitly (-R).
  * Changed router-id computation to use all interfaces, which increases
    the chances of a stable id.
  * Changed the format of babel-state to only contain the seqno -- the
    validation of router-id was useless, and actually harmful when the
    router-id changed multiple times.
  * Fixed a bug with native source-specific routing.  Thanks to Matthieu
    Boutier.

16 June 2015: babeld-1.6.1

  * Fixed a buffer overflow in zone_equal.  This is probably not
    exploitable, but might cause incorrect routing tables in the presence
    of source-specific routing.
  * Added support for defaulting ipv6-subtrees automatically based on the
    kernel version.
  * Fixed compilation under musl.

14 April 2015: babeld-1.6.0

  * Added support for source-specific routing.  Thanks to Matthieu Boutier.
  * Added support for reflecting metrics as kernel priorities.  Thanks to
    Pierre Pfister.
  * Worked around a Linux kernel bug with an infinite EAGAIN loop.  Thanks
    to Dave Taht.
  * Changed wildcard updates to not set flag 0x40.  Reported by Markus
    Stenberg.
  * Made ipv6-subtrees a runtime option.  Thanks to Matthieu Boutier.

4 July 2014: babeld-1.5.1

  * Added support for reading multiple configuration files by specifying
    the -c command-line flag multiple times.
  * Be less noisy about unknown TLV types.  Thanks to Baptiste Jonglez.

22 May 2014: babeld-1.5.0

  * Added support for an RTT-based metric -- see the description of
    "enable-timestamps" in the manual page.  This work was done by
    Baptiste Jonglez with help from Matthieu Boutier.

15 November 2013: babeld-1.4.3

  * Added random-id option to config file (equivalent to -r).
  * Fixed parsing of compressed IPv4 updates.  Thanks to Matthieu Boutier.
  * Fixed formatting of seqno requests with short prefixes.  Thanks to
    Matthieu Boutier.
  * Fixed possible DoS on the local interface.  Thanks to Baptiste Jonglez.
  * Fixed advertising costs higher than INFINITY on the local interface.
    Thanks to Baptiste Jonglez.
  * Fixed an assertion failure when an interface configuration is
    split into multiple config file directives.
  * Disable atomic route changes on BSD, which are buggy at least under
    Mac OS X.  Thanks to Grégoire Henry.

19 June 2013: babeld-1.4.2

  * Extensive changes to the configuration parser.  It is now possible
    to set all command-line options from the configuration file, and
    to specify default values for interface parameters.
  * Allow redistributing routes from multiple kernel tables.  Thanks
    to Toke Høiland-Jørgensen.
  * Fix some whitespace issues in the configuration parser.
  * Fix a bug in the configuration parser that could give wrong values
    to some exotic interface parameters (channel and faraway).
  * Fix a bug that could cause some extra traffic at shutdown.  Thanks
    to Matthieu Boutier.
  * Under Linux, set rp_filter explicitly for all interfaces.  This
    avoids mysterious routing failures on distributions that set
    rp_filter by default.  Reported by Baptiste Jonglez.

19 June 2013: babeld-1.3.8

  * Fix a bug in the configuration parser that could give wrong values
    to some exotic interface parameters (channel and faraway).
  * Fix a bug that could cause some extra traffic at shutdown.  Thanks
    to Matthieu Boutier.
  * Under Linux, set rp_filter explicitly for all interfaces.  This
    avoids mysterious routing failures on distributions that set
    rp_filter by default.  Reported by Baptiste Jonglez.

26 May 2013: babeld-1.4.1

  * Fix a bug that would cause the channel list to remain stuck at its
    initial value when running with -z3.

26 May 2013: babeld-1.3.7

  * Fix a bug that would cause the channel list to remain stuck at its
    initial value when running with -z3.

3 May 2013: babeld-1.4.0

  * Change the route selection algorithm to used a smoothed metric in
    addition to the "real" metric.  This reduces the amount of route
    flapping without any special case hacks.
  * New flag -r, use a random router-id.  This avoids temporarily
    unreachable nodes after a reboot when persistent storage is not
    available.
  * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: the local interface now announces the local
    hostname, and marks the end of the initial route dump.  (Thanks to
    Gabriel Kerneis.)
  * The local interface is now able to accept multiple simultaneous
    connections.
  * Detect BATMAN interfaces, don't assume they are wired.

2 May 2013: babeld-1.3.6

  * Work around recent Linux kernels advertising the IPv6 route cache
    as if it were part of the routing table.  Thanks to Baptiste Jonglez.

12 April 2013: babeld-1.3.5

  * Fix parsing of "channel interfering".  Reported by Gioacchino
    Mazzurco.
  * Correctly reset rp_filter to its old value at shutdown.  Thanks to
    Matthias Schiffer.
  * Work around a race condition that could cause us to fail to notice
    an interface's link-local address, and hence mark all neighbours
    as unreachable.  Reported by Gabriel Kerneis.

8 August 2012: babeld-1.3.4

  * Disable atomic route changes on Linux; this used to cause stuck
    unreachable routes on non-multipath kernels.
  * Improve error checking in command-line and configuration parser.

12 July 2012: babeld-1.3.3

  * More fixes to IPv4 support on BSD -- pure meshes are now
    supported.
  * Fixed a very rare bug where an unfeasible route could be
    selected.

30 June 2012: babeld-1.3.2

  * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: removed parasitic mode (-P).
  * Fixes to IPv4 support on BSD.
  * More reduction to the rate of sending requests.  

11 February 2012: babeld-1.3.1

  * Made the resend logic less aggressive.  This should lead to fewer
    request messages upon link failure, at the cost of somewhat worse
    behaviour in the presence of heavy packet loss.
  * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: removed the idle detection functionality (-i).
    This feature was little used and complicated the code somewhat.
  * Various internal tweaks to bring babeld closer to the Quagga version.

8 December 2011: babeld-1.3.0

  * Made the route table into a sorted array, and use binary sort for
    searching for routes.  This makes most route operations O(log n), at
    a slight cost in memory usage.
  * Changed the update sending strategy to use buffers large enough for
    a full update.  This makes the duplicate suppression mechanism
    effective in large networks, at a small cost in memory usage.
  * Rate-limit the reaction to wildcard requests.  This avoids an update
    storm at boot in large networks.
  * Fixed a bug that prevented usage of the "default" keyword in
    configuration files.

16 October 2011: babeld-1.2.1

  * Fixed an incorrect assertion that would cause a crash when -w was
    being used (reported by Thomas McLure).

9 September 2011: babeld 1.2.0

  * Merged the interference-aware branch ("babelz").  Please see the
    "-z" flag in the manual page.
  * Fixed a memory leak when expiring resent messages.
  * Fixed a buffer overflow when parsing MAC addresses (Matthieu Boutier).
  * Implemented MAC address parsing for BSD (Matthieu Boutier).

27 August 2011: babeld 1.1.4

  * Change the default port number to 6696, as allocated by IANA.

3 August 2011: babeld 1.1.3

  * Implemented an option -u to keep unfeasible routes; this is useful
    for giving more data to front-end interfaces.
  * Fixed a number of minor bugs in the front-end interface.
  * Fixed incorrect handling of interfaces with multiple link-local
    addresses (thanks to Matthieu Boutier).

27 July 2011: babeld 1.1.2:

  * Changed the strategy used to tweak an installed route in a way that
    should avoid packet loss (thanks to Dave Taht).
  * Fixed the handling of duplicate interface definitions in the config
    file (thanks to Matthieu Boutier).

16 May 2011: babeld 1.1.1:

  * Fixed two bugs in the message parser that could cause IPv4 updates to
    get lost.
  * Fixed a bug in the monitoring interface that could cause route ids
    to change (thanks to Gabriel Kerneis).
  * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: the default wired hello interval is now 4 seconds.
  * Ported to Bionic libc.

30 January 2011: babeld 1.1.0:

  * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: the UDP port number and multicast group have
    been changed to be the ones allocated by IANA.
  * Initial port to OpenBSD, by Vincent Gross.

1 October 2010: babeld 1.0.2:

  * Worked around a gcc bug that would cause assertion failures on MIPS.

2 May 2010: babeld 1.0.1:

  * Fixed a bug that could cause input filters to be ignored.

22 April 2010: babeld 1.0:

  * Minor portability fixes.

8 February 2010: babeld 0.98:

  * Implement the ability to prefer Babel routes to external routes
    according to the kernel priority (-A).
  * Implement the ability to redistribute "boot" routes when the protocol
    is explicitly specified on the "redistribute" line.
  * Allow trailing whitespace in config file.

5 November 2009: babeld 0.97:

  * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: rename babel.{conf,log} to babeld.*.
  * Use getopt for parsing command-line options.

11 August 2009: babeld 0.96

  * Renamed babel to babeld.
  * Routes are now automatically flushed when an interface goes down or an
    IPv4 address changes, which avoids desynchronisation between Babel and
    the kernel.

21 April 2009: babel 0.95

  * Fixed a bug that broke link-quality estimation, and could cause
    severe instability when we had both good and marginal neighbours.
  * We now send retractions after a redistributed route is retracted.
  * Fixed a bug that could cause reliable messages (retractions and
    router-id switches) to only be sent twice.
  * We no longer obey a silent time at startup, instead sending a bunch of
    retractions.  The silent time is inconvenient, but seldom useful.
  * Updates for routes to self are now sent together with other updates
    (they used to be sent more frequently).
  * Fixes the configuration parser to interpret hello-interval as a number
    of seconds, as specified in the documentation (it used to be interpreted
    as a number of milliseconds).
  * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: the update interval is now a per-interface value,
    may be configured manually in the configuraton file, and defaults to
    4 times the hello interval.  The -u flag is gone.

10 April 2009: babel 0.94

  * Fixed a bug introduced in 0.17 that caused recently retracted routes to
    remain until the routing table entry was flushed.
  * Implemented per-interface configuration of parameters such as link
    cost, hello interval etc.  The command-line flags are now only used to
    set defaults.

15 March 2009: babel 0.93

  * No longer update seqno periodically, rely on explicit seqno requests.

21 January 2009: babel 0.92

  * Fixed a bug that could cause a crash if an interface was repeatedly
    brought down and then back up.
  * Implemented some protection against time stepping when POSIX clocks are
    not available.

10 November 2008: babel 0.91

  * Maintain buffered updates per-interface, which makes multi-interface
    nodes significantly less noisy.
  * Changed the strategy for dealing with unfeasible routes to be slightly
    more generous while still avoiding loops.
  * Fixed a bug that would cause multi-hop requests to be spuriously resent.
  * Made a number of micro-optimisations throughout.

23 October 2008: babel 0.90

  * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: all new Babel version 2 protocol, which is both
    more robust and less chatty than version 1.
  * Tweaked the strategies for sending triggered updates and unfeasible
    requests to be more conservative.
  * Minor optimisations all over the place.
  * Removed the protocol specification -- the version 2 spec is maintained
    separately.

18 October 2008: babel 0.17

  * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: removed support for ``inherit'' in redistribution.
  * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: a pidfile is now created by default.
  * Increased the default seqno interval.
  * Use a fixed kernel priority for routes installed by babel.

29 September 2008: babel 0.16

  * Tweaked cost computation to be slightly slower.
  * Implemented a local interface for GUIs.
  * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: the -X command-line option is no more.

8 July 2008: babel 0.15

  * Fixed a bug that could break link-quality estimation on yo-yo links.
  * Protect against duplicate neighbour ids on the same interface.
  * More tweaks to improve scaling with the number of kernel routes.
  * Tweaked the default update interval.

1 July 2008: babel 0.14

  * Use POSIX clocks if available to protect against clock stepping.
  * Made babel use available internal routes straight away when the
    set of redistributed routes changes.
  * Lifted the arbitrary limit on the number of kernel routes.
  * Changed the routing metric used on wireless links to plain ETX.
  * Bridges are now automatically detected and treated as potential
    wireless interfaces.
  * Reduced the default hello interval.

24 May 2008: babel 0.13

  * Removed all arbitrary limits (interfaces, neighbours, routes,
    xroutes and sources).
  * Fixed a bug that prevented expiration of stale sources.
  * Updated the kernel interface to work with recent Linux kernels.
  * More tweaks to the order in which updates are sent.

7 April 2008: babel 0.12

  * Retractions are now sent multiple times, which should speed up
    convergence in presence of packet loss.
  * Optimised the sending of updates to make them smaller.
  * Don't forward requests multiple times; this should reduce the
    noise due to requests with no increase in convergence time.
  * Fixed a bug that could cause a crash when resending requests.
  * Added some protection against clock stepping.

29 March 2008: babel 0.11

  * Implemented sub-second hello and update intervals.
  * Fixed a bug that could prevent the best route from being selected
    for extended periods of time.
  * Implemented protection against out-of-date requests being sent and
    forwarded when a node loses its sequence number.
  * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: reduced the cost of wired networks down to 96
    from 128.
  * Tweaked the frequency at which a router's seqno increases, to make
    it more likely that a feasible route will be available when needed.
  * Implemented garbage collection of old sources.
  * Implemented coalescing of unicast messages.
  * Fixed a bug that could cause a crash when a link's MTU changes.
  * Fixed a bug that could delay noticing that a network is no longer
    idle when running Babel with the -i flag.
  * Fixed a bug that could cause incorrect metrics to be advertised
    when output filtering was used.
  * Fixed a bug that could cause incorrect link costs to be computed when
    a neighbour reduces its hello interval.
  * Fixed some minor issues with the ordering of outgoing messages.

11 March 2008: babel 0.10

  * Implemented the ability to automatically export local addresses (see
    the ``local'' keyword in redistribute specifications).  This should
    avoid the need to explicitly specify -X on the command line
    (Julien Cristau and Juliusz Chroboczek).
  * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: local routes (local interface addresses) are
    now exported by default.  Specify ``redistribute local deny'' to
    avoid that.
  * Babel will now automatically choose a router id if none is
    specified on the command line.
  * Automatically adapt to interfaces appearing or disappearing at runtime,
    as is usually the case when running over tunnels or VPNs.
  * Changed the link quality computation algorithm to not discard very
    lossy links.
  * Multi-hop requests will now be forwarded to an unfeasible successor
    under some circumstances.
  * Send multi-hop requests more aggressively.
  * Send requests for a new seqno upon receiving an unfeasible update
    if it's better than what we have.
  * No longer consider the age of routes in route selection.
  * Added ability to run as a daemon.

14 February 2008: babel 0.9

  * Implemented a proper configuration language to specify input and
    output filters and redistribution policies.
  * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: the flags -4, -x and -c are no longer supported.

8 February 2008: babel 0.8

  * Babel will now automatically check for interfaces' up/down status,
    IPv4 address, and optionally for carrier sense.
  * Implemented the -w option, which disables all optimisations for
    wired interfaces.
  * Implemented support for non-default routing tables.
  * Fixed a bug that could spuriously remove IPv4 routes (thanks to
    Julien Cristau).

3 January 2008: babel 0.7

  * Implemented support for IPv4.
  * Fixed sending of unicast requests.
  * Don't send poison when receiving a request for an unknown route.
  * Basic filtering infrastructure.
  * Removed support for broadcast IHU.
  * Changed the behaviour of -d.

16 October 2007: babel 0.6

  * Implemented resending of unsatisfied requests, with exponential backoff.
  * Fixed a potential crash in the request handling code.
  * Send IHUs more aggressively.

9 October 2007: babel 0.5

  * Implemented forwarding of requests and replies.
  * Fixed a bug that prevented requests from being parsed correctly.
  * Fixed a bug that prevented IHU intervals from being sent.
  * Respect reboot_time even after an id change.
  * Deal with neighbours rebooting and losing their hello seqno when
    computing link quality.

23 September 2007: babel 0.4

  * Fixed incorrect expiration of old sources.  This could prevent
    convergence in some cases.

16 September 2007: babel 0.3

  * Fixes to Mac OS X support (Grégoire Henry).

29 August 2007: babel 0.2

  * Made jitter computation depend on how urgent a given message is.
    This dramatically improves convergence speed, without increasing
    network load.
  * Fixed a bug that prevented neighbour associations from being
    discarded at shutdown.

22 August 2007: babel 0.1

  * Initial public release.
